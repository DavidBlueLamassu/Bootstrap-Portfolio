# Portfolio Made with Bootstrap Components (Challenge-Week 3)

## Description
The purpose of this project was to make a new version of a web design portfolio I had created the previous week. This portfolio has the same functionality as before but was contructed using bootstrap components rather than made from code written entirely from scratch. Given that bootstrap components are formatted in order to avoid problems with displaying pages on different screen sizes there was no need to include media queries in this version of the webpage. For ease of comparison, the previous version of my portfolio may be found at: https://davidbluelamassu.github.io/Challenge-Week2/

My new portfolio includes a navbar with internal links, biographical information, and sections outlining my skills and contact details. There is also a work section including the names and titles of some of my recent projects, along with clickable links to these webpages for closer viewing.
